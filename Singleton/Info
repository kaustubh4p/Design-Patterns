we can use singleton design pattern when we need a global resource in our application and whose 
implementation is not going to changed by external class.

- Logging By singleton Class in Java
- Database Connection with Singleton Design Pattern

Drawbacks
a.The caller of singleton class does not know the implementation of singleton design pattern. 
	Because it hides it implementation that makes singleton of lesser use. 
b.	No flexibility for the future to make it more than one like two or three instance. 
c.Singleton class uses static class, block or variable, so no usability of making its subclass.
